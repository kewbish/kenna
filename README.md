Smaller bugfixes or problems can be filed in issues.  
## Naming Note
I recently went on a class trip to [Iceland](http://inspiredbyiceland.com/), and was inspired to name this project after it. According to a Google Translate search (could be 100% wrong), `Kenna` means `to teach` in Icelandic, which I think is fitting.
