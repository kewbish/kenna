## Release Plan
This individual boilerplate, with admin and all other features, will be released for public use for free under the terms of the MIT License.  
However, additional technological support is available under the Kenna Lite and Kenna Suite plans. More information is available on Kenna's [landing page](https://kewbish.github.io/kenna).
Smaller bugfixes or problems with inbuilt templates can be filed in issues.  
## Naming Note
I recently went on a class trip to [Iceland](http://inspiredbyiceland.com/), and was inspired to name this project after it. According to a Google Translate search (could be 100% wrong), `Kenna` means `to teach` in Icelandic, which I think is fitting.
